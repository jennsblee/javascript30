    // start with strings, numbers, and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    let name = 'Jenn';
    let name2 =name
    console.log(name, name2); // Jenn, Jenn
    name = 'Jennifer'; // it will not update the other one by changing the variable
    console.log(name, name2); // Jennifer, Jenn

    // lets say we have an array
    const players = ['Jenn', 'Chloe', 'Maria', 'Katherine'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // you might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Iris'; // because team is only a reference to the array, it changes the players array
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // why? it's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // so, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // slice with no index numbers will give you copy of array

    // or create a new array and concatenate the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // concatenate players array with an empty one

    // or use the new ES6 spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // it will take every item out of the iterable to this new array

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // the same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jennifer Lee',
      age: 24
    }

    // think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; // this will also change the original person object

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100 });
    // atart with blank object, fold in properties of person objct, add new properties
    console.log(captain2, person);

    // we will hopefully see the object ... spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note: this is only 1 level deep - both for arrays and objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it (rearely do you ever actuallly need to clone that deep)

    const jenn = {
      name: 'jenn',
      age: '45',
      social: {
        twitter: '@jennsblee',
        facebook: 'jennlee'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(jenn);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, jenn); // ONLY DOES ONE LEVEL DEEP

    dev.name = 'jennifer'; // will not change jenn's name
    dev.social.twitter = '@jlee9701'; // WILL CHANGE BOTH DEV AND JENN

    // poor man's deep clone

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jenn));
    // make JSON object into a string and immediately parse it back to object, copying it
